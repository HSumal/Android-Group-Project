First we will talk about how we are storing flight info.

All the flight info will be stored in a large .txt file in which each flight will be on a single line, separated with commas (,).

Example: 
(Format follows: Airline Number,Departure Date (YYYY-MM-DD),Arrival Date (YYYY-MM-DD),Airline,Origin,Destination)


123456,2016-11-02,2016-11-09,Danklines,Memeland,Animemeland
8675309,420-6-21,421-6-21,Oldmemers,Past,Future


All the user info will be stored in .txt files with a special formatting scheme.
First all the usernames (e-mails), will be stored in a file labeled Clients.txt (if they’re Client emails) and Admins.txt (if they’re Admin emails).

Example of Clients.txt:

someone@example.ca
mynameis@awesomename.ca
100%guaranteed@awesometa.ca
pleasemarknicely@wereallyneedthisgrade.ca
kappalol@twitchmemes.ca

Example of Admins.txt:

someoneboring@boringexample.ca
ihavetoomuchpower@uscongress.com
donaldtrumpisamaing@trumprallier.com
hillaryclintonorduff@firstworldproblems.com


Then each e-mail for the clients will be the name of a text file which will then hold all their info; whether personal info or billing info.

Example of LittleStuart@mail.ca.txt (Assuming this is a valid filename, with format: First Name, Last Name,Age,Sex,Address,Postal Code,Credit Card/Payment Info ; And then on each new line after the initial info, there will be a list of fights, and each line of flights forms an itinerary):

Stuart,Little,9,M,123 Dank Lane,ABC420,100%RealCreditCardNumber
Flight1/Flight2/…/FlightN
Flight1/Flight2/…/FlightN

Where each flight is formatted as the Flight stated above (Format follows: Airline Number,Departure Date (YYYY-MM-DD),Arrival Date (YYYY-MM-DD),Airline,Origin,Destination)
