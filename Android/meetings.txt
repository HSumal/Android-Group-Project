Status Meeting

Irha and Angela - implemented Users, now working on FlightApp, and testing/commenting.

Jacob and Harpreet - implemented Flight and Itinerary, now working on finished up FlightDatabase, and testing/commenting.

Look forward - how to handle user input, any additional methods we want other than those in our UML.

Planning Meeting (Midway)

Jacob and Harpreet - Almost done implementing FlightDatabase, still need to do comments and a little more testing. May be adding some more methods to help with the User/FlightApp side of things.

Irha and Angela - Almost done implementing FlightApp, all thatâ€™s left is search methods (which will likely use FlightDatabase sort methods), and user input. Still need commenting and a little more testing.

Look Ahead - Need to begin to combine both parts of the program and test it as a whole, and work on the additional classes given like Driver class.
