First we will talk about how we are storing flight info.

All the flight info will be stored in a large .txt file in which each flight will be on a single line, separated with semicolon (;).

Example: 
(Format follows: FlightNumber;DepartureDateTime;ArrivalDateTime;Airline;Origin;Destination;Price)


123456;2016-11-02;2016-11-09;Danklines;Memeland;Animemeland;199.2
8675309;420-6-21;421-6-21;Oldmemers;Past;Future;205.67


All the user info will be stored in .txt files with a special formatting scheme.
First all the usernames (e-mails), will be stored in a file labeled Clients.txt (if they're Client emails) and Admins.txt (if they're Admin emails).

Example of Clients.txt:

someone@example.ca
mynameis@awesomename.ca
100%guaranteed@awesometa.ca
pleasemarknicely@wereallyneedthisgrade.ca
kappalol@twitchmemes.ca

Example of Admins.txt:

someoneboring@boringexample.ca
ihavetoomuchpower@uscongress.com
donaldtrumpisamaing@trumprallier.com
hillaryclintonorduff@firstworldproblems.com


Then each e-mail for the clients will be the name of a text file which will then hold all their info; whether personal info or billing info.

Example of LittleStuart@mail.ca.txt (Assuming this is a valid filename, with format: LastName;FirstName;EmailAddress;CreditCardNumber;ExpiryDate And then on each new line after the initial info, there will be a list of fights, and each line of flights forms an itinerary):

Little;Stuart;littlestuart@hotmail.com;1234567890;2016-08-24
Flight1/Flight2/.../FlightN
Flight1/Flight2/.../FlightN

Where each flight is formatted as the Flight stated above (Format follows: FlightNumber;DepartureDateTime;ArrivalDateTime;Airline;Origin;Destination;Price)
